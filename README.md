Some small yet useful plugins that I felt missing from other libararies

* Navigation extension (inspired by James Montemagno's approach used in Evolve '16 app)
* CardView (extension of Frame, looks cool on iOS as well). The key is [this renderer](https://github.com/aubykhan/ak-xamarin-plugins/blob/master/AK.Xamarin.Plugins.iOS/Renderer/CardViewRenderer.cs) which can be linked with Frame as well to make it appear as nice Material Card.
