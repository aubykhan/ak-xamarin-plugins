# ak-xamarin-plugins
Some small yet useful plugins that I felt missing from other libararies

* Navigation extension (inspired by James Montemagno's approach used in Evolve '16 app)
* CardView (extension of Frame, looks cool on iOS as well). The key is [this renderer](https://github.com/aubykhan/ak-xamarin-plugins/blob/master/AK.Xamarin.Plugins.iOS/Renderer/CardViewRenderer.cs) which can be linked with Frame as well to make it appear as nice Material Card.
* ListUtil. For now, it has one method that has the boilderplate code to handle list item selection and preventing item highlighting.

# How to use this repo?
For now, this repo acts as code reference and anyone can copy whatever works into their own projects. This will remain the same until I add further components here to make it eligible for a decent nuget package.
